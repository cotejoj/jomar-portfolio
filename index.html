        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I’m <span class="highlight">Jomar Cotejo</span> 👋. I’m deeply passionate about programming and currently focused on building my skills as a software developer. My journey began in <span class="highlight">system support and IT support</span> 🖥️, where I developed a strong foundation in troubleshooting, maintaining infrastructure, and assisting end users across multiple environments.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over time, I realized that what excites me most is solving problems through code 💻—whether it’s automating a task, improving a workflow, or building something new from scratch. I have experience with <span class="highlight">C# and Visual Basic</span>, and have recently been diving into web technologies like 
            <span class="highlight">HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React</span> 🚀. I’m actively building projects to strengthen both my front-end and back-end development skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            I bring with me practical IT experience, a systems mindset, and a drive to keep learning 📚. I’m currently working on personal projects, expanding my understanding of full-stack development, and looking forward to joining a team where I can grow, contribute, and write clean, purposeful code.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of tech, I enjoy <span class="highlight">gaming 🎮</span> and <span class="highlight">watching anime 📺</span>. I love getting immersed in creative worlds—whether it’s through code, games, or stories. I believe learning should be fun, and I try to bring that energy into everything I do.
        </p>
